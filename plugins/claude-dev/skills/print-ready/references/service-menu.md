# Print Ready service menu

Version 0.7.41. This is the tool menu advertised by the running MCP server.

All tool calls use POST /mcp with JSON-RPC method tools/call and params.name plus params.arguments.
GET /tools returns the same descriptions, input schemas and annotations as MCP tools/list. GET /menu returns this readable reference.

OpenSCAD uses millimetres. +Z is up, front is viewed from -Y, and right from +X.
STL export happens automatically when create_model completes. get_model returns fresh STL, PNG and manifest download links. Set include_source=true to retrieve editable SCAD only when the user asks. Downloads last at most ten minutes; ask get_model for new links.

## Renders and exports

create_model compiles complete source and returns a 640 x 640 PNG sheet. Upper left is isometric, upper right front, lower left top, lower right right.
render_view returns a 320 x 320 PNG for isometric, front, back, left, right, top, bottom, custom or bed_contact. It reuses the compiled STL and returns the same source/STL geometry in that view job.
Custom azimuth runs from -360 to 360 degrees and defaults to -45. Zero points from +X and positive angles turn toward +Y. Elevation runs from -90 to 90 and defaults to 35. Zero is level, +90 is top, -90 is bottom. Camera fitting is automatic.
bed_contact shows the footprint within 0.05 mm of the minimum Z of the source geometry. It does not alter the STL or prove adhesion.
The sheet is automatic at model creation, not a render_view choice. Resolution, lighting and material color are fixed. render_view supports orthographic zoom from 0.25 to 2, default 1. Larger values enlarge the model and may crop it. create_3mf packages ready STL models with named parts and materials. create_colored_relief combines PNG palette refinement, tracing, height bands and print files in one job. refine_artwork and trace_artwork expose the stages separately. The host image generator supplies new artwork. Submit a separate SCAD cutaway variant for a section plane.

## Modeling references

get_print_ready_skill, get_colored_reliefs_skill, get_openscad_cheatsheet, get_bosl2_cheatsheet and get_welcome_skill return the same authored skills packaged with the plugin. get_capabilities advertises them. These read-only tools do not open the welcome screen. Show the guide only on requested help.

## Tools

### get_capabilities

Get this connection's environment, release version, deployed SHA, endpoint, rendering limits, libraries, reference skill tools and signed-in state. Confirm the requested Dev or production environment before rendering or choosing a signed-in App. Never switch a Dev workflow to production because that connection is signed in. Preserve render_quota_token for preparation and render calls across authorized routes.

### create_model

Create a printable part from complete OpenSCAD source, a required detailed English brief and required design decisions. Compiles a binary STL in source orientation and a 640 x 640 sheet of real isometric/front/top/right previews. Returns a queued job handle; poll get_model for status, intent, images and STL/PNG/manifest downloads; request SCAD only when the user asks. Reuse identical source, brief, decisions and tokens for retries. A new revision uses a new preparation. Link revisions with previous_model and other parts in this conversation with context_model. To package ready STL models with material colors, call create_3mf.

Guest use is available; authenticated identity is used when supplied.
Annotations: {"title":"Render model","readOnlyHint":false,"destructiveHint":false,"openWorldHint":false}

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| render_quota_token | no | Optional render quota capability returned by the existing signed-in Print Ready connection. Preserve and pass it across modeling tool routes to use that account allowance. Grants no profile, library or model access. Refresh through the existing connection if expired; do not sign in again or silently fall back to guest quota. |
| context_model | no | An authorized model handle from this conversation, with its guest access token when needed. Pass it for another part, cutaway or test in the same conversation. This preserves session correlation when the host omits conversation metadata. It does not grant access to other models. For a revision, previous_model already carries this context. |
| previous_model | no | For a revision, reference the earlier model ID and its guest access token if needed. The service uses this link to count iterations. Each revision keeps its own files and access. |
| imagegen_used | no | Report whether image generation has been used in this conversation. Supply true or false when known. Omit when unknown. |
| name | yes | Part name and visible version, at most 100 characters. Name separate parts and cutaway/test variants distinctly. |
| source | yes | Complete OpenSCAD source in millimetres, at most 180000 UTF-8 bytes. BOSL2 is available. Model in the intended print orientation with the bed face at Z=0. |
| brief | yes | Required detailed English model intent, 40 to 10000 characters. Describe purpose, use, mating parts, dimensions, measured facts, fit requirements, known printer/material constraints and assumptions. Summarize the request rather than copying chat messages. |
| decisions | yes | Required design notes, 1 to 30 entries of at most 2000 characters each. Explain orientation, bed face, support/bridge choices, fit parameters, fasteners, assumptions and changes from the previous revision as relevant. |
| idempotency_key | yes | Use the key from prepare_model. Reuse it only for retries of identical source, brief and decisions. A new revision needs a new key. |
| access_token | yes | Secret from prepare_model. Required for submission and guest retrieval. Preserve privately with the handle. |
| erasure_token | yes | Separate secret from prepare_model for deletion, including after guest downloads expire. Preserve privately. |

### trace_artwork

Convert PNG artwork or a ready refine_artwork handle into layered vector outlines. Call prepare_model first. Poll get_model for the flattened preview, SVG and contour JSON. Pass this job as artwork to create_colored_relief.

Guest use is available; authenticated identity is used when supplied.
Annotations: {"title":"Trace artwork","readOnlyHint":false,"destructiveHint":false,"openWorldHint":true}

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| render_quota_token | no | Optional render quota capability returned by the existing signed-in Print Ready connection. Preserve and pass it across modeling tool routes to use that account allowance. Grants no profile, library or model access. Refresh through the existing connection if expired; do not sign in again or silently fall back to guest quota. |
| context_model | no | An authorized model handle from this conversation, with its guest access token when needed. Pass it for another part, cutaway or test in the same conversation. This preserves session correlation when the host omits conversation metadata. It does not grant access to other models. For a revision, previous_model already carries this context. |
| previous_model | no | For a revision, reference the earlier model ID and its guest access token if needed. The service uses this link to count iterations. Each revision keeps its own files and access. |
| imagegen_used | no | Report whether image generation has been used in this conversation. Supply true or false when known. Omit when unknown. |
| name | yes | Part name and visible version, at most 100 characters. Name separate parts and cutaway/test variants distinctly. |
| brief | yes | Required detailed English model intent, 40 to 10000 characters. Describe purpose, use, mating parts, dimensions, measured facts, fit requirements, known printer/material constraints and assumptions. Summarize the request rather than copying chat messages. |
| decisions | yes | Required design notes, 1 to 30 entries of at most 2000 characters each. Explain orientation, bed face, support/bridge choices, fit parameters, fasteners, assumptions and changes from the previous revision as relevant. |
| idempotency_key | yes | Use the key from prepare_model. Reuse it only for retries of identical source, brief and decisions. A new revision needs a new key. |
| access_token | yes | Secret from prepare_model. Required for submission and guest retrieval. Preserve privately with the handle. |
| erasure_token | yes | Separate secret from prepare_model for deletion, including after guest downloads expire. Preserve privately. |
| file | no | Host file parameter for an attached or generated PNG of the printable artwork. |
| image_url | no | Reachable HTTPS URL or PNG data URL for the printable artwork. Send only the art to be traced. |
| artwork | no | Handle from refine_artwork or trace_artwork, with guest access token if needed. |
| palette | no | Ordered #RRGGBB filament colors. First is the base. Use the loaded colors when specified. Unmatched regions require an intentional color_map. Omit to select colors from the image. |
| color_map | no | Intentional source-to-filament substitutions. Each source is a distinct #RRGGBB from the artwork. Each target is in palette. Omit to preserve the artwork colors. |
| colors | no | Maximum number of automatically selected colors, including the base. Default 4. |
| footprint | no | Rectangle fills transparent pixels with the base color. Silhouette keeps transparent areas open. |
| cleanup | no | Clean small color artifacts when selecting colors automatically. Defaults to true for new images. |
| resolution_px | no | Longest edge of the tracing grid in pixels. Defaults to 480. |

### create_colored_relief

Refine a printable PNG, trace it and build a raised sign or decoration in one job. Generate new art in the loaded colors and pass them as palette when specified. Call prepare_model, submit a file, image_url or ready artwork handle, and poll get_model. Defaults to four colors including the base. Checks that the compiled bands match the flattened artwork. Inspect the top preview and compare its color regions before delivering the 3MF with show_model.

Guest use is available; authenticated identity is used when supplied.

### create_3mf

Package one or more ready Print Ready STL models as a new 3MF model. Call prepare_model first. Set named parts, material colors, grouping, scale and offsets as needed. Separate objects can be resized independently in the slicer. Shared object names keep parts registered. Choose Bambu Studio filament assignments or standard 3MF. Poll get_model and call show_model for the new result. This tool works with any ready Print Ready STL.

Guest use is available; authenticated identity is used when supplied.
Annotations: {"title":"Create 3MF","readOnlyHint":false,"destructiveHint":false,"openWorldHint":false}

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| render_quota_token | no | Optional render quota capability returned by the existing signed-in Print Ready connection. Preserve and pass it across modeling tool routes to use that account allowance. Grants no profile, library or model access. Refresh through the existing connection if expired; do not sign in again or silently fall back to guest quota. |
| context_model | no | An authorized model handle from this conversation, with its guest access token when needed. Pass it for another part, cutaway or test in the same conversation. This preserves session correlation when the host omits conversation metadata. It does not grant access to other models. For a revision, previous_model already carries this context. |
| previous_model | no | For a revision, reference the earlier model ID and its guest access token if needed. The service uses this link to count iterations. Each revision keeps its own files and access. |
| imagegen_used | no | Report whether image generation has been used in this conversation. Supply true or false when known. Omit when unknown. |
| name | yes | Part name and visible version, at most 100 characters. Name separate parts and cutaway/test variants distinctly. |
| brief | yes | Required detailed English model intent, 40 to 10000 characters. Describe purpose, use, mating parts, dimensions, measured facts, fit requirements, known printer/material constraints and assumptions. Summarize the request rather than copying chat messages. |
| decisions | yes | Required design notes, 1 to 30 entries of at most 2000 characters each. Explain orientation, bed face, support/bridge choices, fit parameters, fasteners, assumptions and changes from the previous revision as relevant. |
| idempotency_key | yes | Use the key from prepare_model. Reuse it only for retries of identical source, brief and decisions. A new revision needs a new key. |
| access_token | yes | Secret from prepare_model. Required for submission and guest retrieval. Preserve privately with the handle. |
| erasure_token | yes | Separate secret from prepare_model for deletion, including after guest downloads expire. Preserve privately. |
| format | yes | Bambu Studio filament assignments, or standard 3MF materials and build items. |
| bed_center_mm | no | Placement center for Bambu Studio, in mm. Defaults to [128,128]. |
| parts | yes | Authorized ready models. Use common source coordinates for parts that must align. |

### record_model_image

Report imagegen use for an authorized model and retain the generated image when available. Optional image_url accepts exported PNG, JPEG or WebP data or a public HTTPS image URL, up to 4 MiB. Stores originals until explicit model erasure. Omit image_url when the host cannot export the image. The service cannot see other imagegen tools or open sandbox/private host references. Do not invent URLs or image bytes. Only submit generated illustrations. Never upload user reference photos, screenshots or composites containing them; omit image_url for those.

Guest use is available; authenticated identity is used when supplied.
Annotations: {"title":"Save generated image","readOnlyHint":false,"destructiveHint":false,"openWorldHint":true}

| Parameter | Required | Description |

### render_view

Render one 320 x 320 preview from existing STL geometry. Choose isometric, front, back, left, right, top, bottom, custom or bed_contact. Custom azimuth/elevation are degrees; bed_contact shows the footprint within 0.05 mm of minimum Z. Does not alter print orientation, recompile source or accept section planes. Returns a queued view handle; retrieve it with get_model. Each new view consumes one render admission.

Guest use is available; authenticated identity is used when supplied.
Annotations: {"title":"Render view","readOnlyHint":false,"destructiveHint":false,"openWorldHint":false}

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| render_quota_token | no | Optional render quota capability returned by the existing signed-in Print Ready connection. Preserve and pass it across modeling tool routes to use that account allowance. Grants no profile, library or model access. Refresh through the existing connection if expired; do not sign in again or silently fall back to guest quota. |
| model_id | yes | Completed parent model or view job UUID. Reuses its existing STL; does not recompile or reorient the part. |
| access_token | no | Guest access secret for the parent model. Omit for an owned saved model. |
| idempotency_key | yes | New random key for this view; reuse on retry with exactly the same camera options. |
| view | yes | Single 320 x 320 view. bed_contact projects the footprint within 0.05 mm of minimum Z. The four-view sheet is generated by create_model. |
| zoom | yes | Orthographic zoom, 0.25 to 2, default 1. Larger values enlarge the model and may crop it. |
| azimuth | no | Custom camera azimuth in degrees, -360 to 360, default -45. Zero views from +X; positive rotates toward +Y. Use only with view=custom. |
| elevation | no | Custom camera elevation in degrees, -90 to 90, default 35. Zero is level, +90 is top, -90 is bottom. Use only with view=custom. |

### get_model

Retrieve model or view job status, detailed English brief, design decisions, compiler error and mesh bounds. Ready jobs include a native PNG image block and explicit file links plus binary STL, PNG and manifest download links valid for at most ten minutes. Set include_source=true only when the user requests editable SCAD. The manifest includes intent, engine/library versions and compiler warnings. Repeating this read does not consume a render. Use the guest access secret or the authenticated owner. Older models may have no stored intent. Inspect the real preview yourself. When delivering show_model, use its interactive viewer without also displaying PNGs in chat. Display the PNG only when requested or when the host cannot show the viewer.

Guest use is available; authenticated identity is used when supplied.

### show_model

Open one model or an ordered collection of up to 20 models in the interactive in-chat STL viewer. First retrieve and inspect the real previews with get_model. Supply models in the order you want the numbered file list to appear; the first opens initially. Choose the models and their order to suit the task. Give diagnostic cutaways and printable parts distinct names. Users click numbered entries or arrows, or swipe the file strip on touch screens. The name, dimensions and STL download always refer to the selected file. Drag the viewport to rotate, scroll or pinch to zoom, and select preset cameras. Bed-contact faces at Z=0 appear darker without changing geometry. Camera movement and paging do not start render jobs. Guest capabilities and owned saved models are supported; a real PNG is shown if WebGL is unavailable. The client preloads the supplied STL files for paging. Use this viewer as the visual delivery without also posting PNG previews in chat. The Share button creates a public URL for the selected part, with this same rotatable viewer and an STL download and inline SCAD and model-details views. Sharing happens through the user-operated button. Stop sharing revokes the link. Always supply conversation_models with all available model handles from the current chat, including earlier revisions, separate parts and test variants, so My models can list them for guests. This gallery list does not change the selected files or their order. For models with a 3MF, the viewer offers Download 3MF and Download all files.

Guest use is available; authenticated identity is used when supplied.
Annotations: {"title":"Show model","readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"openWorldHint":false}

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| model_id | no | Single model or view UUID. Supply either model_id with its access_token, or the ordered models array. |
| access_token | no | Original guest secret for the single model_id. Omit for an owned saved model; use each array entry's token when supplying models. |
| models | no | Ordered list of 1 to 20 distinct model handles. Each entry has model_id and its original guest access_token when required. The first item opens initially; this exact order becomes the numbered file list. Each item has its own STL download. Choose useful ordering and clear model names, including for cutaways or fit tests. Do not also supply the top-level model_id or access_token. |
| conversation_models | no | All available model handles from this chat, up to 1000, each with model_id and its original guest access_token when required. Supply on every show_model call, even when showing one part. Used by My models separately from the numbered viewer files. Each handle is authorized individually. Do not invent handles or include handles from another chat. |
