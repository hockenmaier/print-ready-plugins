# BOSL2 modeling reference

Read the [practical BOSL2 reference](references/bosl2-basics.md). It covers the library included in Print Ready, required include files, positioning, boolean tags, mechanical examples and upstream documentation links.

Call `get_capabilities` to confirm the installed version. Print Ready currently pins BOSL2 2.0.766 at commit `e173fa0ae45f9e2082e0d8c0382dae98621b7c20`. The upstream wiki changes independently, so check the pinned implementation when a newer example uses unfamiliar arguments. Prefer named arguments. Compile and inspect real geometry before claiming a mechanism works; physical fit still requires the user's printer and measurements.

MCP-only clients can call `get_bosl2_cheatsheet` for this skill and its reference. This read does not render a model or open the welcome guide.

For custom FDM mating threads, use `trapezoidal_threaded_rod(thread_angle=90)` for 45 degree flanks and the identical profile with `internal=true` for the female cutter. The reference gives the 8 mm diameter, 2 mm pitch, 0.60 mm radial depth starting profile, 0.40 mm flat lands and one-time female `$slop=0.15` clearance. Use chamfered entries, blunt lead-ins and vertical print axes. Physical testing determines the final clearance.
